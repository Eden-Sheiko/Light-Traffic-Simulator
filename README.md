# Light Traffic Simulator
This is a simple Arduino sketch that simulates a traffic light using three LEDs. The sketch cycles through the following sequence of colors:

1. Red for 5 seconds.
2. Yellow for 1 second.
3. Green for 3 seconds.
4. Yellow for 1 second.
5. Back to red.
## Hardware Requirements
To run this sketch, you will need the following components:

* 3 LEDs (one for each color)
* 3 resistors (one for each LED)
* An Arduino board
* Jumper wires
## Installation
1. Connect the LEDs to the digital pins of the Arduino board, using the resistors to limit the current flow.
2. Upload the sketch to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or another compatible software.
3. Run the sketch and observe the LEDs to see the traffic light sequence.
